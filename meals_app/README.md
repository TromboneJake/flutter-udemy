# 🍔 Meals App
An app for discovering meals by cuisine. It features multiple screens including a filter select screen for a user to toggle and display only meals that fit those filters, such as vegan or gluten-free. This app features state management with the [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) package.

The next section focuses on adding animations to the app. Check back soon for that!

## ✨ Features  
- View a list of cuisine categories and select one to view meals from it
- Favorite a meal to add it to your favorites list for easy access
- Filter out certain meals based on dietary restrictions such as gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, or vegan

## 🗒️ Notes
This section focused on navigation and routing between multiple screens, with a navigation bar and side drawer, and managing state and data between them. Afterwards, the app was updated to remove state management by passing around code and instead to manage app-wide state via [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/). App animations and transitions are coming soon!
