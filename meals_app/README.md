An app for discovering meals by cuisine. It features multiple screens including a filter select screen for a user to toggle and display only meals that fit those filters, such as vegan or gluten-free.

The next section of the course focuses on 2 different statemanagement solutions - Riverpod and Provider. The section after that is about adding animations. Both of these will be added to this app so check back for those updates.

## ✨ Features  
- View a list of cuisine categories and select one to view meals from it
- Favorite a meal to add it to your favorites list for easy access
- Filter out certain meals based on dietary restrictions such as gluten-free, lactose-free, vegetarian, or vegan

## 🗒️ Notes
