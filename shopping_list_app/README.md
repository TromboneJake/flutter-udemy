# 🛒 Shopping List App
An app for creating a simple shopping list. This app will store a list on a Firebase backend to persist the data. It also explored using Form elements in Dart and Flutter and handling user interaction. This app does not have user authentication so the list will be the same for all users but the purpose was to demonstrate how to do a Firebase data storage and http requests, and user authentication will be taught later on.

## ✨ Features  
- View a list of shopping items
- Add or remove items from the shopping list
- Keep items stored remotely on a Firebase backend.

## 🗒️ Notes
This section demonstrated how to connect a backend to your app using Firebase and http requests. It also explained how form-specific elements work differently than just basic text or other input widgets. There is validation logic built in to the form widgets and the input connects up easier to the overall form. I may revisit this after the course is finished and add user specific shopping lists so each user can create and manage their own list.
