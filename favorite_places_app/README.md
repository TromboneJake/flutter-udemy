# 🗺️📍 Favorite Places App
An app to make a list of your favorite places. Uses device hardware like camera to take a picture of the place and then Google Maps API to put a map pin and explore the place. This data is then stored and retrieved locally in an SQFlite database.

## ✨ Features  
- Create a list of your favorite places
- Take a picture of the place as well as put a pin on a map
- Explore the place later on the map and view the picture

## 🗒️ Notes
This section taught how to implement device features like using the camera, as well as a little bit of permissions for camera and gps. It showed how to utilize another api, Google Maps, in several different ways to build out a location picker as well as current location feature, and then to display an image of the map location and human readable address with latitude and longitude coordinates. Afterwards it implemented an SQFlite database to store all of this information locally so a user can come back later and view their favorite places.
