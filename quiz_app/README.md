# 🤔 Quiz App  

A multi-screen Flutter application that allows users to take a quiz and see their score and correct answers at the end. I changed the questions and may add functionality to upload custom questions

## ✨ Features  
- Start the quiz and select an answer to the question
- At the end, view your results as well as the correct answers
- Retake the quiz and attempt a better score

## 🗒️ Notes
This section of the course covered more state management as well as implementing multiple screens and passing state, functions, and values between them. I changed the question set to fitness and nutrition focused ones instead of Flutter themed ones. I might go back and add functionality to create or upload your own question sets later on.

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Ensure Flutter is installed ([Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)).  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd quiz_app
