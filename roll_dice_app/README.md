# 🎲 Roll Dice App  

A simple Flutter app that lets you roll various polyhedral dice, including d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. This expanded version of the course project allows users to select their desired die type and features custom artwork I had generated with a Python script.

## ✨ Features  
- Choose from multiple polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20).  
- Randomized dice rolls. 
- Custom-generated artwork for a unique look.  

## 🗒️ Notes
This section of the course covered the basics of the Dart language and Flutter framework, including importing packages, how widgets and widget trees work, using classes and object-oriented programming, variable types, and some basic state logic. After completing the base project I went back and reimplimented the [StyledText](https://github.com/TromboneJake/flutter-udemy/blob/main/roll_dice_app/lib/styled_text.dart) custom widget, as well as continued using state and Stateful widgets to add the ability to select from a range of polyhedral dice. These correspond and display images I created as SVGs using a Python script and then converted to PNGs. 

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Ensure Flutter is installed ([Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)).  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd dice_roll_app
